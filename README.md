Here is some information about the game that you may find useful:

Rules: The game is played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (a closed fist), 
paper (a flat hand), or scissors (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, 
and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied.


Here are some additional tips for playing Rock, Paper, Scissors:

Don't be afraid to mix up your choices. If you keep choosing the same shape, your opponent will eventually figure it out and start winning.
Try to read your opponent's body language and facial expressions. If you can see that they are looking at their scissors hand, then you know to choose rock.
If you are playing against a computer opponent, try to learn its strategy. Some computer opponents will choose randomly, while others will have a more sophisticated strategy.
Have fun! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a great game to play with friends and family.
